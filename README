This is a ruby newbie app based on sinatra and datamapper to try out creating, listing, editing and deleting "contacts" from a database: firstname, lastname, email, and an id (key).

1. fetch the code
2. cd contacts
3. ruby -rubygems contact.rb
4. In a browser, go to http://127.0.0.1:4567/contacts  (ymmv)
5. Click the 'Reset' link to populate the database with a few contacts
6. add new, view or edit existing, or delete contacts until you're bored silly.
